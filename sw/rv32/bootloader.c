// Filename: 	bootloader.c
//
// Project:	ZipVersa, Versa Brd implementation using ZipCPU infrastructure
//
// Purpose:	To start a program from flash, loading its various components
//		into on-chip block RAM, or off-chip DDR3 SDRAM, as indicated
//	by the symbols/pointers within the program itself.  As you will notice
//	by the names of the symbols, it is assumed that a kernel will be placed
//	into block RAM.
//
//	This particular implementation depends upon the following symbols
//	being defined:
//
//	_rom:
//		The address of the beginning of a physical ROM device--often
//		a SPI flash device.  This is not the necessariliy the first
//		usable address on that device, as that is often reserved for
//		the first two FPGA configurations.
//
//		If no ROM device is present, set _rom=0 and the bootloader
//		will quietly and silently return.
//
//	_kram:
//		The first address of a fast RAM device (if present).  I'm
//		calling this device "Kernel-RAM", because (if present) it is
//		a great place to put kernel code.
//
//		if _kram == 0, no memory will be mapped to kernel RAM.
//
//	_ram:
//		The main RAM device of the system.  This is often the address
//		of the beginning of physical SDRAM, if SDRAM is present.
//
//	_kram_start:
//		The address of that location within _rom where the sections
//		needing to be moved begin at.
//
//	_kram_end:
//		The last address within the _kram device that needs to be
//		filled in.
//
//	_ram_image_start:
//		This address is more confusing.  This is equal to one past the
//		last used block RAM address, or the last used flash address if
//		no block RAM is used.  It is used for determining whether or not
//		block RAM was used at all.
//
//	_ram_image_end:
//		This is one past the last address in SDRAM that needs to be
//		set with valid data.
//
//		This pointer is made even more confusing by the fact that,
//		if there is nothing allocated in SDRAM, this pointer will
//		still point to block RAM.  To make matters worse, the MAP
//		file won't match the pointer in memory.  (I spent three days
//		trying to chase this down, and came up empty.  Basically,
//		the BFD structures may set this to point to block RAM, whereas
//		the MAP--which uses different data and different methods of
//		computation--may leave this pointing to SDRAM.  Go figure.)
//
//	_bss_image_end:
//		This is the last address of memory that must be cleared upon
//		startup, for which the program is assuming that it is zero.
//		While it may not be necessary to clear the BSS memory, since
//		BSS memory is always zero on power up, this bootloader does so
//		anyway--since we might be starting from a reset instead of power
//		up.
