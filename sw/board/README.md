## Legacy ZipCPU board-specific software

This file contains several ZipCPU programs, ported from other projects, used to
help bootstrap this design.  There are a basic [cputest](cputest.c), two
library tests: [hello](hello.c) world and [gettysburg](gettysburg.c), and a
simple [ping](simple_ping.c) testing program.
