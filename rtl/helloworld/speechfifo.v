// Filename: 	speechfifo.v
//
// Project:	ZipVersa, Versa Brd implementation using ZipCPU infrastructure
//
// Purpose:	To test/demonstrate/prove the wishbone access to the FIFO'd
//		UART via sending more information than the FIFO can hold,
//	and then verifying that this was the value received.
//
//	To do this, we "borrow" a copy of Abraham Lincolns Gettysburg address,
//	make that the FIFO isn't large enough to hold it, and then try
//	to send this address every couple of minutes.
//
//	With some minor modifications (discussed below), this RTL should be
//	able to be run as a top-level testing file, requiring only that the
//	clock and the transmit UART pins be working.

// One issue with the design is how to set the values of the setup register.
// (*This is a comment, not a verilator attribute ... )  Verilator needs to
// know/set those values in order to work.  However, this design can also be
// used as a stand-alone top level configuration file.  In this latter case,
// the setup register needs to be set internal to the file.  Here, we use
// OPT_STANDALONE to distinguish between the two.  If set, the file runs under
// (* Another comment still ...) Verilator and we need to get i_setup from the
// external environment.  If not, it must be set internally.
