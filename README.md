This repository will eventually feature a working [ZipCPU](https://zipcpu.com/about/zipcpu.html) on an [ECP5 Versa board](https://www.latticestore.com/products/tabid/417/categoryid/59/productid/22434/default.aspx).

For now, all the work is taking place in the [dev branch](https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipversa/tree/dev).
